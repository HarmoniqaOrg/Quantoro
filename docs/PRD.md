## ðŸš€ Strategic Pivot & Enhancement Plan (Effective 2025-06-27)

**Status: In Enhancement Phase**

### 1. Rationale for Pivot

Following a comprehensive review of the completed baseline project, a strategic decision was made to elevate the implementation from a standard academic exercise to a competition-grade quantitative strategy. The initial implementation successfully met all assignment requirements but lacked the sophistication and statistical rigor of cutting-edge research. This enhancement phase aims to address these gaps by integrating advanced, academically-validated techniques.

### 2. Refined Enhancement Strategy

Based on empirical results and model performance, the enhancement strategy has been refined to prioritize robustness and proven alpha sources:

1.  **Ensemble Regime Detection (Task B Fix)**: The standalone MRS-GARCH model demonstrated flawed logic. It will be replaced by a robust ensemble model combining the strengths of two diverse approaches:
    *   **Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover**: The original, highly interpretable, and proven baseline model will provide the primary trend signal (70% weight).
    *   **Corrected MRS-GARCH Model**: The MRS-GARCH detector's logic will be fixed to correctly identify high-volatility regimes. It will serve as a secondary, more nuanced signal based on market microstructure (30% weight).
    *   **Academic Grounding**: This ensemble approach is grounded in research showing that combining diverse, weakly correlated models yields more robust results than a single complex model (*Timmermann, 2006, "Forecast Combinations"*).

2.  **Advanced Alpha Strategy (Task C Enhancement)**: To boost alpha generation, we will enhance the existing FMP signal processor with a new, academically-backed signal:
    *   **Cross-Asset Momentum**: Implementing signals based on the findings of *PitkÃ¤jÃ¤rvi et al. (2020), "Cross-asset signals and time series momentum"*. This strategy leverages the predictive power of bond market returns (proxied by SPY) on future equity performance.
    *   **Hand-Picked Feature Selection**: The automated Boruta feature selection process proved ineffective (selecting zero features). We are pivoting to a domain-knowledge-based approach, creating a curated list of high-signal features (e.g., `AAPL_insider_trades`, `NVDA_analyst_recs`) in a dedicated `feature_config.py`. This pragmatic approach prioritizes signal quality over automated complexity.

3.  **Balanced Optimizer Parameters**: Based on backtest results, the `RegimeAwareCVaROptimizer`'s parameters will be adjusted to a more balanced and practical range (e.g., CVaR alpha from 0.93 to 0.97), avoiding the extreme risk-on/off postures that can lead to instability.

### 3. Expected Outcomes

This strategic pivot is expected to deliver significant improvements across all key metrics, targeting a Sharpe Ratio > 1.10 and an Information Ratio > 0.40, backed by statistically significant p-values.

## Project Overview
Implementation of CVaR-LASSO Enhanced Index Replication (CLEIR) with ML enhancements for eToro Alpha Pods assignment.

## Current Sprint: Project Setup
- **Objective**: Initialize project structure and development environment
- **Success Criteria**: All files created, dependencies installed, initial commit pushed
- **Design Decisions**: 
  - Using CVXPy for optimization (proven CVaR support)
  - PyTorch for ML models (better transformer support)
  - Async architecture for data fetching (FMP rate limits)

## Architecture Decisions Log
- **2024-01-XX**: Selected 60 most liquid S&P 100 stocks to balance diversification and liquidity
- **2024-01-XX**: Chose quarterly rebalancing to minimize transaction costs while maintaining responsiveness

## Technical Specifications
- **CVaR Confidence Level**: 95% (Î± = 0.95)
- **Max Position Size**: 5%
- **Transaction Costs**: 10 bps per side
- **Rebalancing**: Quarterly
- **Lookback Window**: 252 trading days
- **2025-06-25**: Replaced the `pytickersymbols` library with a hardcoded list of 60 tickers. **Reason**: The library provided an unstable list containing non-common stock tickers (e.g., preferred shares), causing silent failures in the data loading pipeline. A fixed list ensures reproducibility and stability.
- **2025-06-25**: Enhanced the data loader (`FmpDataLoader`) to handle individual ticker API failures gracefully using `asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)` instead of failing the entire batch.
- **2025-06-25**: Switched the default CVXPY solver from `ECOS` to `SCS` to resolve "solver not installed" errors and improve out-of-the-box compatibility.
- **2025-06-25**: Implemented a fallback mechanism in the rolling backtester to hold previous weights if an optimization step fails, preventing the backtest from crashing and ensuring continuity.
- **2025-06-26**: Designed and implemented an alpha-aware optimization strategy. **Components**:
    - **Data Source**: Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) for alternative data signals (analyst recommendations, insider trading).
    - **Signal Processing**: A `SignalProcessor` class normalizes and combines raw signals into a single composite alpha score per asset.
    - **Optimization**: The `AlphaAwareCVaROptimizer` modifies the core CVaR objective function to `Minimize(CVaR - alpha_factor * PortfolioAlpha)`, creating a dual-objective to balance risk minimization with alpha maximization.

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Primary Metric**: The enhanced strategy (Task B) must outperform the baseline strategy (Task A) on a risk-adjusted basis (Sharpe Ratio) over the 2020-2024 backtest period. **(Achieved for baseline)**
- **Secondary Metric**: The final report must be clear, professional, and fully reproducible. **(In Progress)**

## 7. Final Project Status

**Status: In Enhancement Phase**

All tasks outlined in the assignment have been successfully implemented, backtested, and documented. The project is now undergoing a strategic enhancement phase to elevate the strategies to a competition-winning level of sophistication, with a focus on dynamic alpha, advanced regime detection, and rigorous statistical validation.
