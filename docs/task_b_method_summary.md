# Task B: Regime-Aware CVaR - Method Summary

Our project enhances the baseline CVaR optimization strategy by incorporating a dynamic, regime-aware framework designed to adapt to changing market volatility. The core hypothesis is that by identifying distinct market regimes—specifically, periods of high and low turbulence—we can adjust the portfolio's risk posture to improve risk-adjusted returns and mitigate drawdowns.

For regime detection, we selected a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with two hidden states. This model was trained on a key feature derived from the S&P 500 index (SPY): its 22-day rolling volatility. The HMM effectively learns to segment the market's behavior into two primary states, which we interpret as 'Risk-On' and 'Risk-Off'. The 'Risk-Off' state consistently aligns with periods of high market stress and volatility, such as the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and the market downturns of 2022. Conversely, the 'Risk-On' state corresponds to periods of relative calm and stable growth.

The primary innovation lies in how our CVaR optimizer leverages this regime information. The strategy is not static; it dynamically adjusts its core parameters at each quarterly rebalance based on the prevailing regime identified by the HMM. During a 'Risk-Off' period, the optimizer adopts a defensive stance. The maximum allowable weight for any single asset is tightened from 5% to 3%, and the LASSO regularization penalty is increased by 50%. These adjustments promote greater diversification and penalize concentrated bets, aiming to preserve capital during turbulent times. In 'Risk-On' periods, the optimizer reverts to its standard, less restrictive parameters, allowing it to pursue growth more aggressively.

This adaptive approach moves beyond traditional static optimization. By systematically responding to quantifiable shifts in market volatility, the regime-aware strategy aims to achieve a more robust performance profile. It seeks to intelligently navigate the trade-off between risk and return, offering a sophisticated mechanism for managing portfolio tail risk in a constantly evolving financial landscape. The backtesting results validate this approach, demonstrating the model's ability to correctly identify and adapt to different risk environments, thereby providing a more resilient investment strategy.
