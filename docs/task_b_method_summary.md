# Task B: Regime-Aware Model - Method Summary

The primary innovation of Task B was to enhance the baseline CVaR portfolio strategy with a dynamic risk management framework capable of adapting to changing market conditions. The core of this enhancement is a sophisticated regime detection model that quantitatively assesses the market environment, allowing the portfolio optimizer to adjust its risk posture in real-time.

Our methodology is centered on the `EnsembleRegimeDetector`, a model designed for robustness and clarity. It produces a continuous probability score (from 0.0 to 1.0) indicating the likelihood of the market being in a "Risk-Off" state. This is achieved by combining the signals from two distinct sub-models, each capturing a different facet of market behavior. The first is a trend-following model based on Simple Moving Averages (SMA), which identifies the primary market direction and carries a 70% weight in the final score. The second is a Mean Reversion Speed (MRS) model, which measures market volatility and choppiness, contributing the remaining 30%.

This blended approach provides a more nuanced view than a single model could. It can effectively distinguish between a stable, low-volatility downtrend and a chaotic, high-volatility market, assigning a higher "Risk-Off" probability to the latter. This probabilistic output is then fed directly into our `RegimeAwareCVaROptimizer` at each quarterly rebalance.

The optimizer is configured with two distinct parameter sets: a `RISK_ON` profile (lower risk aversion, higher concentration limits) and a `RISK_OFF` profile (high risk aversion, strict diversification). It dynamically interpolates between these two profiles based on the regime probability. For instance, a 75% "Risk-Off" probability will shift the optimizer's parameters three-quarters of the way towards the defensive `RISK_OFF` settings. This allows the portfolio to fluidly adapt its risk posture, becoming progressively more defensive as market turbulence increases, rather than making abrupt, binary changes.

This adaptive framework proved highly effective during the 2020-2024 backtest period, successfully navigating the COVID crash, the subsequent bull market, and the 2022 downturn. By systematically adjusting its risk-taking based on a quantitative assessment of the market environment, the strategy successfully enhanced the risk-adjusted returns of the baseline model.
