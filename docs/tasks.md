## âœ… Completed Milestones

- [x] **Project Setup & Initialization**
- [x] **Task A: Baseline CVaR Index**
  - [x] Implemented CVaR optimization based on the CLEIR paper.
  - [x] Correctly applied transaction costs at each rebalance.
  - [x] Extended backtest to cover the full 2010-2024 period by seeding initial returns.
  - [x] Generated all required results, including a final cumulative index.
- [x] **Task B: Regime-Aware Enhancement (Feedback Addressed)**
  - [x] Implemented `EnsembleRegimeDetector` using SMA and Volatility signals.
  - [x] Implemented `RegimeAwareCVaROptimizer` with dynamic parameter adjustment.
  - [x] Addressed all evaluation feedback: fixed look-ahead bias, applied transaction costs, and generated a comparable baseline for 2020-2024.
  - [x] Backtested successfully and analyzed results; found that the strategy did not outperform the baseline on a risk-adjusted basis.
- [x] **Task C: Hybrid ML Alpha Model**
  - [x] Implemented data loader for FMP signals and ML model for alpha generation.
  - [x] Implemented `AlphaAwareCVaROptimizer` to integrate alpha scores.
  - [x] Successfully debugged and backtested the full hybrid model.
- [x] **Core Infrastructure & Debugging**
  - [x] Resolved all solver issues by standardizing on 'SCS'.
  - [x] Refactored core backtest engine for robustness.
  - [x] Implemented and validated equal-weighted benchmark.
  - [x] Created robust `Makefile` for easy execution.
- [x] **Code Quality & Finalization**
  - [x] Resolved all dependency conflicts in `requirements.txt`.
  - [x] Fixed all linting (E402, F821, F841) and formatting issues.
  - [x] Ensured `make quality` passes cleanly.
  - [x] Fixed all failing unit tests for Task B pipeline.
